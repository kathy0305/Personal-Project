Florida Parks 

Called FL state and requested historical data of all their public parks attendance, location (address and lon,lat) as well as entrance fee.

Had to make the request through email
got an email back from Sophia.Arteaga@dep.state.fl.us
Got 13 seperate excel files for each year starting from year 2002-2014

the file was protected as read-only

the state did not send me all the requested info, like geo location
as emailed twice
